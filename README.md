# tables-identifiers-using-binary-tree

(06.08.2022)
Write a program that simulates the operation of the components of a given file system. Visualize the operation of the program and the final results on different sets of input data.

Build tables of identifiers using the binary tree method. The tree should be perfectly balanced and orderly. Provide the possibility of additional inclusion and exclusion of identifiers while maintaining balance. Provide the ability to search for a given identifier with a printout of the search path and display of a tree view. Use one letter and two numbers as identifiers.
